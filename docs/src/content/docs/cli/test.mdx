The `qang test` command discovers and runs tests in QangLang projects.

## Usage

```bash
qang test <path> [options]
```

### Arguments

- `<path>` - Path to a test file or directory containing tests (required)
  - If a directory is provided, all test files will be discovered and run recursively

### Options

- `--debug` / `-d` - Enable debug output during test execution
- `--heap` / `-m` - Dump compiled bytecode and heap contents before test execution
- `--eformat` / `-e` - Error message format (default: `verbose`)
  - `minimal` - Shows minimal error information
  - `compact` - Shows compact error messages
  - `verbose` - Shows detailed error messages with full context

## Examples

### Run a Single Test File

```bash
qang test tests/my_test.ql
```

### Run All Tests in a Directory

```bash
qang test tests/
```

### Run Tests with Debug Output

```bash
qang test tests/ --debug
```

### Show Bytecode During Tests

Useful for debugging test failures:

```bash
qang test tests/failing_test.ql --heap
```

### Use Compact Error Format

```bash
qang test tests/ --eformat compact
```

## Test File Conventions

By default, the test runner looks for files that:

- Have the `.ql` extension
- Are located in test directories or match test naming patterns

## Test Output

The test runner provides:

- Individual test results (pass/fail)
- Error messages for failed tests
- Summary statistics (total tests, passed, failed)
- Execution time information

## Exit Codes

- `0` - All tests passed successfully
- `1` - One or more tests failed or encountered errors

## Use Cases

### Running Tests During Development

Quickly verify your changes:

```bash
qang test tests/unit/
```

### CI/CD Integration

Run all tests in your continuous integration pipeline:

```bash
qang test tests/ --eformat compact
```

### Debugging Failing Tests

Get detailed information about test failures:

```bash
qang test tests/failing_test.ql --debug --heap --eformat verbose
```
