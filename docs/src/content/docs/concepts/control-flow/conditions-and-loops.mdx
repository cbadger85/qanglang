There are several ways to handle conditional control flow in QangLang.

## `if` and `else` Statements

`if` statements can be used to run code only when the condition is `true`.

```ql
if (true) {
  // Do something
}
```

`if` can be combined with `else` to run code when the condition is `false`.

```ql
if (false) {
  // This won't run
} else {
  // This will run.
}
```

`if` and `else` can be chained together to handle multiple conditions.

```ql
if (first_condition) {
  // Do the thing for the first condition
} else if (second_condition) {
  // Do the thing for the second condition
}
```

## Ternary and `when` Expressions

For expressions, the ternary expression can be used to handle simple if else logic.

```ql
var absolute_value = value >= 0 ? value : value * -1;
```

For more complicated conditional logic in an expression, a `when` expression can be used. For the conditional `when` expression, the left side is an expression that if evaluated as truthy, will evaluate the expression on the right.

```ql
var sign = when {
  value > 0 => "positive",
  value == 0 => "zero",
  value < 0 => "negative",
}
```

`when` expressions can also supply a value to match against. The match `when` expression checks the left side for equality with the value. If equal, then the expresson on the right will be evaluated.

```ql
fn get_hex_color(color) {
  return when (color) {
    "red" => "#FF0000",
    "green" => "#00FF00",
    "blue" => "#0000FF",
    "black" => "#000000",
    else => "#FFFFFF"
  }
}
```

The `is` operator can also be used to match against the type. If the value matches the type on the left, the expression on the right will be evaluated.

```ql
var value = when (result) {
  is Ok => result.unwrap()
  is Err => "default"
}
```

Sometimes a simple expression may not be enough. In those instances, an Immediately executed lambda can be used to wrap the statements.

```ql
var value = when (result) {
  is Ok => result.unwrap()
  is Err => () -> {
    // Do something on this line
    // Then do something on this line
  }()
}
```
