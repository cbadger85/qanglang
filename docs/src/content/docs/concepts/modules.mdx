title: Modules and Imports
description: Using modules in QangLang
---

All files in QangLang are modules. Modules are declared using the `mod` keyword and path to the module is provided with the `import` keyword.

```ql
mod lib = import("./lib.ql");
```

When a module is imported the first time, it is executed and cached.

```ql title="lib.ql"
println("Library imported!");
```

```ql title="main.ql"
mod lib = import("./lib.ql"); // "Library imported!"

fn main() {
  mod lib = import("./lib.ql");
}

main(); // Nothing prints because the lib.ql has already executed.
```

Modules are also readonly, so a field on a module cannot be reassigned.

```ql
mod math = import("./math.ql");

math.sqrt = identity; // This is an error because math.sqrt cannot be reassigned.
```
