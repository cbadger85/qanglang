description: Booleans in QangLang

Booleans in QangLang are represented by `true` and `false` values.

```ql
var is_true = true;
var is_false = false;
```

## Falsy values

In addition to `false`, `nil` is also treated as `false` for boolean operations, while every other value is treated as `true`.

```ql
var is_falsy = nil;
var is_truthy = "This should be truthy.";

var condition = is_falsy or is_truthy; // true
```
