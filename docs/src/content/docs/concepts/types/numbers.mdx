description: Numbers in QangLang

All numbers in QangLang are represented as 64 bit floats and are always represented as decimal values. Other representations (such as binary or hexadecimal) are not recognized.

## Operations on Numbers

QangLang supports basic arithmetic operations of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`.

```ql
println(-1 + 1); // 0
println(1.5 - 1); // 0.5
println(10 / 2); // 5
println(4 * 3); // 12
println(6 % 4); // 2
```

### Division by Zero

Because QangLang has no representation of infinity, division by zero will result in an error and the program stopping.
