All strings in QangLang are represented by `UTF-8`. All strings are interned, making them immutable and immortal for the life of the program.

<Aside type="caution">
  Because of how QangLang handles strings, strings should not be used for
  sensative information such as passwords.

## Converting a Value to a String

There is no implicit conversion of strings in QangLang. When using the `+` operator to concatenate, ensure both values are strings by using the [`to_string` function](/reference/api/globals#to_string).

```ql
var hello = "Hello";
var space = " ";
var world = "World!";
println(hello + space + world); // "Hello World!"

var name = "Jane Doe";
var age = 25;
println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + to_string(age)); // "Name: Jane Doe, Age: 25"
```
