title: Range Reference
description: A reference for the Range iterator implementation
---

A `Range` is a finite stream of numbers that start at the specified number and increment by one until the sepcified end. It inherits from [`Sequence`](/reference/api/iterators/sequence/).

## Constructor

Creates a `Range` between two numbers.

```ql
var range = Range(0, 10);
```

#### Parameters

start: `Number` - The number to start the range with (inclusive).

end: `Number` - The number to end the range with (exclusive).

## Methods

### Inherited

All methods are inherited from the `Sequence` class. See the [Sequence reference](/reference/api/iterators/sequence#methods) for documentation.

## Example

```ql
var seq = Range(0, 5).for_each(print_ln);
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```
